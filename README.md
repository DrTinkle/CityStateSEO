# City/State SEO Plugin for Wordpress

## About the City/State SEO Plugin

I created the **City/State SEO Plugin** to help businesses improve their local SEO by automating the creation of city- and state-specific posts and adding structured data to boost search engine visibility. If you're looking to enhance your local online presence, this plugin makes it easy to generate location-targeted content and improve your rankings in local search results.

### Key Features:

- **Automated Post Generation:** The plugin creates custom posts for every city and state automatically, so your site gets filled with localized content that can drive more traffic.
- **Structured Data Built-In:** Structured data is automatically added to each post, helping search engines understand your content better and rank it higher in local search.
- **Customizable Post Types:** You can tailor the post types and structured content to fit your business strategy and SEO goals.

### Shortcodes for Templates:

I’ve added a set of shortcodes to make content creation even easier. These can be used in your post templates:

- `[location_name]` and `[in_location_name]` display the location's name.
- `[location_usa]` adds the location's name followed by ", USA".
- `[city_st]` and `[in_city_st]` show the city name and state abbreviation.
- `[city_state]` and `[in_city_state]` show the full city name and state.

If a city isn't found, the shortcodes default to the State name, and if neither is found, they return an empty string—so your content is always clean and accurate, even when data is missing.

## How to Use It

Here’s a quick guide on how to get started:

1. **Enter Your Business Info:** First, go to the 'Business Info' submenu and add your details. This ensures that all the posts generated match your business and SEO needs.
2. **Set Up Custom Post Types:** Use the 'Custom Post Types' submenu to define the kind of posts you want to create.
3. **Generate Location-Specific Posts:** Head to the generation tabs to create location-based posts automatically. This will improve your local SEO by filling your site with content targeted to different cities and states.
4. **Apply Templates with Shortcodes:** Use templates and the shortcodes provided to generate dynamic, SEO-friendly content.
